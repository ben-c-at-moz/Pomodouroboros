"""
Model v2.

Spec:

    - https://github.com/glyph/Pomodouroboros/issues/33

What events can occur?

    - time passes, which results in

        - pomodoro progresses

        - pomodoro ends

        - break starts

        - break ends

    - user adds a new intention to the set of available ones

    - user sets an intention from the created set

        - this is different than the current system because expressing an
          intention always results in a new pomodoro (unless one's currently
          running of course)

    - user evaluates their intentionality

3 kinds of intervals

    - pomodoro

    - break

    - grace period

Okay so what is the *alignment* on these grace periods?  Do they begin at the
time when they are originally scheduled to start, or do they start only after
the intention is set?

I think it would make the most sense to have everything aligned up front, so
you can have some visibility into the future, but to have the grace period
itself.
